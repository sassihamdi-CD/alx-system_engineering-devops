# Postmortem: Incident Report - Service Outage

### Issue Summary:

Duration: The outage occurred on January 20, 2024, starting at 14:30 UTC and lasted for approximately 2 hours.

Impact:
- The affected service was the user authentication system.
- Users experienced a complete inability to log in, resulting in a service downtime.
- Approximately 35% of users were unable to access their accounts during the outage.

Root Cause:
- The root cause of the issue was identified as a database connection failure due to a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.

Timeline:

- Detection Time: The issue was detected on January 20, 2024, at 14:30 UTC through a monitoring alert indicating a sudden spike in failed authentication attempts.

- Detection Method: The monitoring system triggered an alert based on a predefined threshold for authentication failures.

- Actions Taken:
  - Investigated the authentication service logs and identified a high rate of database connection errors.
  - Assumed the root cause to be a database server issue and initiated an investigation into the database infrastructure.

- Misleading Paths:
  - Initially pursued a database-focused investigation, leading to unnecessary downtime as the actual issue was misattributed.

- Escalation:
  - The incident was escalated to the DevOps and Database Administration teams.

- Resolution:
  - The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer, disrupting database connections.
  - The load balancer settings were corrected, restoring normal database connectivity and resolving the authentication service outage.

### Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
- The issue was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to database connection failures.

Resolution:
- The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration to ensure proper distribution of traffic to the database servers.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
- Conduct a thorough review of load balancer configurations across all critical services.
- Enhance monitoring thresholds for early detection of database connection issues.

Tasks:
1. Conduct load balancer configuration audits for all services within the next week.
2. Implement automated alerting for load balancer-related issues to minimize response time in the future.
